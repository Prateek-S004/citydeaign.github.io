    <h1>Mapping Business Cases to SDG Targets and Indicators</h1>
<div class="container">
    <div class="use-case">
        <h2>Efficient and Proper Public Transport</h2>
        <p><strong>SDG Target 11.2:</strong> Access to Safe, Affordable, and Sustainable Transport Systems</p>
        <p><strong>Indicator 11.2.1:</strong> Proportion of the population with convenient access to public transport, by sex, age, and persons with disabilities.</p>
        <p>This use case focuses on creating accessible and efficient public transport for everyone, especially women, children, and the elderly. It reduces traffic congestion and pollution by encouraging public transit over personal vehicles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="use-case">
        <h2>Smart Revenue Systems</h2>
        <p><strong>SDG Target 11.3:</strong> Inclusive and Sustainable Urbanization</p>
        <p><strong>Indicator 11.3.2:</strong> Proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban planning and management that operate regularly and democratically.</p>
        <p>Smart revenue systems ensure sustainable urban growth by funding better infrastructure and urban planning. They encourage public-private partnerships and create new revenue sources to support economic development.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="use-case">
        <h2>Smart City Search Engine with Service Recommendations</h2>
        <p><strong>SDG Target 11.7:</strong> Access to Safe and Inclusive Public Spaces</p>
        <p><strong>Indicator 11.7.1:</strong> Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use for all, by gender, age, and persons with disabilities.</p>
        <p>A smart city search engine makes city services easier to access and use. It offers recommendations for services like healthcare, education, and recreation, ensuring inclusivity for all residents, including those with limited access to technology.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="use-case">
        <h2>Other Effects</h2>
        <p><strong>SDG Target 11.6:</strong> Reduce Environmental Impact</p>
        <p><strong>Indicator 11.6.2:</strong> Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in cities (population-weighted).</p>
        <p>While not directly addressing pollution, these solutions reduce environmental impacts by promoting efficient public transport and resource optimization through digital services.</p>
