            <h2>What is the Course About?</h2>
           <p>Our course, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, introduces us to the fundamentals of algorithms and data structures, focusing on their design, analysis, and application.<br>
           We start with core concepts like time and space complexities, recursion, and backtracking. Next, we delve into tools like hashing and Union-Find, along with advanced data structures such as AVL Trees, Segment Trees, and Red-Black Trees. Sorting and searching algorithms, including Quick Sort, KMP, and Rabin-Karp, help us understand efficient data processing techniques.<br>
           Graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s shortest path and Prim’s spanning tree, and case studies such as the Travelling Salesperson Problem, show us how algorithms solve complex, real-world problems. The course also introduces concepts like NP-completeness and the limitations of algorithmic power.<br>
           By the end, we gain a strong foundation in computational thinking and the ability to develop efficient solutions to challenging problems.</p>

            <h2>What kind of data structures and algorithms have we studied so far?</h2>
            <strong>Math Basics:</strong>
            <p>We started our journey to the algorithm world from understanding the basic concepts of maths which serve as fundamental for this course.</p>
            <p>In the math basics we learnt how do you find out and calculate the time and space efficiency for a solution or recurrence relation.Then we saw problems such as 
            Tower of Brahma, n queens problem</p>
            <strong>Math foundations:</strong>
            <p>We then moved onto the discussing about the math foundations where we were introduced to the concepts of orders of growth. Using the order of growth we understood in more 
                detail about the efficiency of a solution</p>
            <strong>Structure Data Management:</strong>
            <p>Further we moved on to the country of structured data to know how we should manage them. In this we came across n-ary trees in that we mainly focused on binary trees</p>
            <p>We started from binary tree which on mutation with searching algorithm lead to binary search tree.Further we saw 2-3 trees which was not so balanced and to reduce this skewness
            we saw AVL tree which reduced the skewness.Further we moved onto the Red-Black tree which works on giving efficent performances for insertion and deletion.
            Along with these we even saw Trie and skip lists where the skip list provide easy insertion of data and the trie works on pointers.Then there was BIT/Fenwick which was based on 1-based index array
            further there was the topics about heap how it wirks and the algorithm of heap.At last there was the BFS and DFS which were the real troublemakers but also were really important for further adventure
            on the tour of algorithm world</p>

            <strong>Sorting methods:</strong>
            <p>This was where the real fun as well as the scary part began as the sorting algorithms piled up one by one as a heap.The inventions of different algorithms starting from bubble sort to the heap sort
            was an exhaustive process(at a corner i could hear the laugh of evil).</p>

            <h2>How do you connect the course with real-time applications?</h2>
            <p>Many algorithms we study in this course draw inspiration from nature or observations of real-world practices. 
                For example, the *shortest path algorithm* mimics the work of electricians optimizing wiring paths, and *insertion sort* is derived from how gamblers organize cards by inserting them in the correct position.
                This course not only teaches us how these algorithms were designed but also offers insights into the thought processes of their inventors.</p>
            <p>In terms of real-world applications, this course is deeply relevant: </p>
            <h3>Smart City Design</h3>
            <p>In our project, we apply algorithms like *Dijkstra’s, **Prim’s, and **Kruskal’s* for optimizing road networks and transport systems. We also leverage data structures and algorithms for smart traffic management, public transport optimization, and resource distribution across different zones such as healthcare, education, and agriculture.</p>
            <h3>Sorting and Searching</h3>
            <p>Sorting algorithms are vital in organizing large datasets quickly, allowing businesses to process and analyze information efficiently. For example, search engines and databases rely heavily on these techniques to deliver accurate results in minimal time.</p>
            <h3>Tree Data Structures</h3>
            <p>Trees are used in *file systems* to maintain hierarchical data (as seen in operating systems) and in *compilers* for syntax trees.</p>
            <h3>Hashing</h3>
            <p>Hashing is indispensable in cybersecurity for secure password storage and in databases for efficient retrieval of information.</p>
            <h3>Competitive Programming and Problem Solving</h3>
            <p>The techniques we learn, such as <strong>*dynamic programming, **graph traversal, and **string matching*</strong>, are frequently applied in solving challenging problems in coding competitions and real-world software development.</p>
            <h3>Advanced Applibations</h3>
            <p>Algorithms like *backtracking* and *greedy algorithms* help in real-time scenarios such as scheduling, resource allocation, and AI-based decision-making (e.g., in gaming or automated trading systems).</p>
            <h3>Real-Time Decision Making</h3>
            <p>Techniques such as data compression and optimization methods are widely used in areas like logistics, delivery route planning, and improving system efficiency.</p>
            <p>This course bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application, enabling us to approach real-world challenges with the efficiency and precision required in technology-driven fields.</p>
