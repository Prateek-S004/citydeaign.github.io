            <h2>What is the Course About?</h2>
            <p>This course mainly dives deep into the world of algorithms, discussing how they were created to solve real-life problems.</p>
            <p>It explores what inspired their creation, their efficiency, and the improvements made over time.</p>

            <h2>What kind of data structures and algorithms have we studied so far?</h2>
            <strong>Math Basics:</strong>
            <p>We started our journey to the algorithm world from understanding the basic concepts of maths which serve as fundamental for this course.</p>
            <p>In the math basics we learnt how do you find out and calculate the time and space efficiency for a solution or recurrence relation.Then we saw problems such as 
            Tower of Brahma, n queens problem</p>
            <strong>Math foundations:</strong>
            <p>We then moved onto the discussing about the math foundations where we were introduced to the concepts of orders of growth. Using the order of growth we understood in more 
                detail about the efficiency of a solution</p>
            <strong>Structure Data Management:</strong>
            <p>Further we moved on to the country of structured data to know how we should manage them. In this we came across n-ary trees in that we mainly focused on binary trees</p>
            <p>We started from binary tree which on mutation with searching algorithm lead to binary search tree.Further we saw 2-3 trees which was not so balanced and to reduce this skewness
            we saw AVL tree which reduced the skewness.Further we moved onto the Red-Black tree which works on giving efficent performances for insertion and deletion.
            Along with these we even saw Trie and skip lists where the skip list provide easy insertion of data and the trie works on pointers.Then there was BIT/Fenwick which was based on 1-based index array
            further there was the topics about heap how it wirks and the algorithm of heap.At last there was the BFS and DFS which were the real troublemakers but also were really important for further adventure
            on the tour of algorithm world</p>

            <strong>Sorting methods:</strong>
            <p>This was where the real fun as well as the scary part began as the sorting algorithms piled up one by one as a heap.The inventions of different algorithms starting from bubble sort to the heap sort
            was an exhaustive process(at a corner i could hear the laugh of evil).</p>
